            "content_html": "<h3 class=\"align-center\">Felt like the week passed by in a day.</h3>\n<p>Spend the last days going to the arcades n' browsing the marketplace a little. Sylph n' I played a lot of stuff. In the Indie Arcade, we played this game called <a href=\"https://flop-mongers-website.vercel.app/gunfish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gunfish</a>. Party-like game. Various fish to choose that each have unique properties to their gun shot. Win condition is reducing your opponent's lives to zero. We played a bit of it n' Syl got a few points off me on me. BUT, being the <em><strong>GAY</strong>MER</em> I am 😤 I won the match. Actually... idk I can't remember, but I'll just say I did :)</p>\n<p>I later pulled Syl over to this game called <a href=\"https://www.goldengrave.com/works/waddle-throttle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Waddle Throttle</a>. Caught my eye... cuz... penguins. I love penguins. The cabinet had an interesting control scheme. Only two action buttons per player. How ya control your penguin's speed is that mash the two buttons back and forth. Like imitating a waddle (GET IT?). Then to drift left or right, ya hold down a button. Hold down both buttons to slow your momentum.</p>\n<p>Over all, Waddle Throttle's a fun game. Didn't get a change to play it, but the figure skating mode sounded like a great time. Syl n' I played the King of Hill mode. She won n' was the last penguin standin'! The \"PENGWIN\" win screen got a chuckle outta me 🐧</p>\n<p>We later went over to the arcade<strong> <em>arcade.</em></strong> Forgot to take a pic, but it was funny seein' Daytona's arcade hardware out on a little stand they had. Dunno what it is, but I enjoy lookin' at printed circuit boards. Anyway, loved playin' this Daytona game. Always play on manual stick if I can since half of the fun is controlling that speed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/Daytona.jpg\" alt=\"A back view of the arcade game, Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge.\" width=\"850\" height=\"491\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Daytona-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Daytona-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Daytona-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Daytona-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>When we got the rhythm game section, Syl started playing this giant cabinet that had a piano-like controller. Interesting game, Nostalgia. Nothin' like playin' a real piano though. Mimics it just to enough to give the feelin' ya are. Unfortunately, it was hard to hear since MAGfest put all the rhythm games in a corner, so sounds overlapped. There was a headphone jack on the cabinet, but not everyone's carryin' 3.5mm headphones/IEMs (unlike me since I be like that). So, we had to get close to hear it.</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: center; margin: 1.2em;\"><video loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" controls=\"controls\" controlslist=\"nodownload\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/Bantz/Documents/Publii/sites/-blog/input/media/files/Syl's-Rhythming.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>\n<p class=\"align-center\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center; margin: -0.6em auto 0.8em;\">Syl probably would do better if she could hear the music lol.

Syl played this Godzilla themed one. Complained a lot that the game was a bit rigged. Ball kept being magnetized towards the gutter n' whatnot.</p>\n<p>I played a bit of the Star Wars Mandalorian one that was right next to Syl. It was pretty much the same in terms of rigged difficulty. Syl got a pretty good score by the end of it. Despite the harsh difficulty lol.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\">The last day I spent at the Marketplace to buy the stuff I wanted.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper align-center\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/merch_1.jpg\" data-size=\"1280x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/merch_1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Various enamel pins, acrylic charms, keychain, and a crochet plushie.\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/merch_2.jpg\" data-size=\"1280x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/merch_2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Stickers of various characters from anime, video games, and a original character.\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Not all pictured above was bought.

Can't thank her enough for all the cute/funny stuff she gave me. Anyway, going over what I bought myself.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">First up is this Clickily keychain I got from <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/RoseGoldJelly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rose Gold Jelly!</a></p>\n<div class=\"align-center align-left\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: center; margin: 1.2em;\"><video loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" controls=\"controls\" controlslist=\"nodownload\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/Bantz/Documents/Publii/sites/-blog/input/media/files/Clickly-Kirby.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>\n<p class=\"align-center\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center; margin-top: -0.6em;\">CW: flashing lights</p>\n<p>Yeah, this is gonna stay with me at all times. I love Kirby. Also, once the battery runs out on this thing, I can take the keycap n' add it to my keyboard. Slowly gonna fill my entire function row with custom keycaps. Need to get something Gogeta or Dragon Ball related eventually...</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Next is this Moogle crochet plush by Crochet Creatives.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/mogglepenguin.jpg\" alt=\"A crochet plush of a Moogle from Final Fantasy.

This one is fashioned after the 2nd entry in the series I believe. The only FF game I've played is Final Fantasy Chronicles, so wish I could find a plush similar to the Moogle in that one. Though, I still found this plush cute to get anyway. Most other FF games I only know by osmosis from friends that've info dumped about 'em to me lol.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Showin' off stickers that were gifted to me :)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/stickers_gifts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"487\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/stickers_gifts-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/stickers_gifts-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/stickers_gifts-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/stickers_gifts-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>Syl gave me the Sonic related stickers after seein 'em. Forgot to ask who's the artist, so if ya know, please reach out to me on my socials! Anyway, the upper middle n' right stickers are ones that Syl made herself! Got a good laugh outta me :D - As for the Master Chief n' Cortana one, that was made by a friend, my homie Screwy, of a friend: <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/hoshizoralone.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lone</a>. Very cute sticker!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Last of the stickers are the ones I bought from <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/mickeyn163\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mickeyn</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper align-center\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/sticker_oni.jpg\" data-size=\"729x1000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/sticker_oni-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sticker of a red-skinned oni original character.\" width=\"729\" height=\"1000\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/stickers_Vegeta.jpg\" data-size=\"1000x788\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/gallery/stickers_Vegeta-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sticker of Vegeta holding a jovial pokemon, Spheal, while saying, \" width=\"768\" height=\"605\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>They had sticker <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDKcxfuxg3A/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I really wanted</a>, but I was bit too late n' it was sold out. A sticker that has Super Sayian 4 Goku and Vegeta makin' out while text that says, \"Hop on FighterZ\". Understandable since it was a really good (mad funny too) sticker. Also, I really liked their Oni original character so much that I bought a sticker of 'em n' <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/gogeta.red/post/3lgyggtoiex2t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drew 'em</a>!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Bought these charms so I could decorate my sling bag!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/Bag_full.jpg\" alt=\"A long, gray sling bag with acrylic charms on its zippers and loop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"486\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Bag_full-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Bag_full-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Bag_full-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Bag_full-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>Charmin' my sling up.

A character from Limbus Company. The second charm I got is pixel art of Tekken's King by <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shiny Seabass</a>. Third's a cute chibi Testament charm by <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/AtelierPudding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atelier Pudding</a>. Lastly, I got a small PS1 Controller charm. Unfortunately, I didn't get the name of the artist for the PS1 one... again. Gonna laugh if someone stops me about that Limbus Company charm. I have no idea what it's about aside what Syl n' Naotox have told me about it.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Anyway, I love all these charms.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/Bag_close-up.jpg\" alt=\"A close up shot of a sling bag.

The very first pin I got was from my good friend Syl. A Waddle Dee n' Kirby kissin'! They're dressed up as characters from a manga/anime called Delicious in Dungeon. All I know is they build <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-705T4FioZE?t=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pesbian</a> (still dunno what Gunna meant by that LOL). Also, Syl gave me that fluffy squiggle (idk if that its name) that's near the kissin' Waddle Dee n' Kirby pin. Believe it's from a manga. tho... i forgor💀 to ask.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/Jacket_close-up.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of top half of a denim jacket.

Bought this off Nao's friend, <a href=\"https://blueandredwares.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bo</a>. They gave me a discount for the set since I was friends with Nao. That was nice of 'em! Thank ya! Next pin I bought was an Okami set of Amaterasu and Issun. Only bought the set since I couldn't get Amaterasu by herself. Rather not have a bug, <em><strong>BUG</strong> </em>me. Ya feel me? Last pin I got was this cute Kitten Kaboodle by <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/clarabellumsart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clara Kay</a>. Pin's a two piece attached by a red chain, a calico cat punting away a red yarn ball.</p>\n<p>The other three pins on my jacket I already had before I went to MAGfest. One being a wide, round cartoon cat that says \"BIG BOY\" was made by <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/1090134004/shitty-kitty-25mm-wooden-pins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vaahlkult</a>. The other being a cartoon crow perched on a hunting knife was made by <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sabtastic.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sabtastic</a>. Last one is a Día de los Muertos pin of a sugar candy skull I got from a local event I went to in my hometown. Oh yeah, almost forgot to show off the other two Golden Sun Djinn I have on bottom half of my jacket.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/Jacket_bottom.jpg\" alt=\"Close up the bottom half of a denim jacket showing off two enamel pins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"489\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Jacket_bottom-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Jacket_bottom-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Jacket_bottom-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/12/responsive/Jacket_bottom-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Love how my jacket looks.

They're great. I love this fluffy squiggle. As I hanged with Syl for bar, Space Lion showed up! Lion n' I talked about retro handhelds for a bit. Specifically, the Analogue Pocket. Amazed how well these hardware emulation devices are gettin'. If I was a physical game hoarder, I'd honestly get it.</p>\n<p>Gonna fast forward a bit to when after I picked up my badge. Lion, Syl' friends, are still at a bar we'd hopped to from another. Some are a little drunk while others are hittin' their limit. My friend, Cheese, just appears outta nowhere n' chants to me \"Draw Kirby. Keep drawing Kirby.\"</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>\"Oh, I'm a little high.\" </em></p>\n<p>Syl's friend manages to convince Cheese to drink this coffee bean beverage they got. He orders the drink. As he takes a few sips, he asks, \"I shouldn't chug this?\" I tell him, \"Doesn't sound like a good idea.\" </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">He chugs it.</p>\n<p>As we explore the floors of the Gaylord, Cheese would periodically sing the hook from Lil' Wayne's \"Good Kush and Alcohol.\" He n' Syl would rant at each other over how shit Elon n' Trump are (very true). Cheese would repeat stories about a few times or just forget to finish 'em. He constantly tell me every few hours he's sober... \"I'M ON THAT GOOD KUSH AND ALCOHOL!\"</p>\n<p>Syl's friends wanted to get some cosplay photos. So we'd head up a balcony to get some photos. Cheese says to me, \"Hey man, let's get a selfie together.\"</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/11/selfie-moment.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"667\" height=\"750\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/11/responsive/selfie-moment-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/11/responsive/selfie-moment-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/11/responsive/selfie-moment-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.bantz.art/media/posts/11/responsive/selfie-moment-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>When we reached the gazebo and after he sing the Cardcaptor Sakrua opening theme to me. He'd hold on to me in a moment of sincerity—this motherfucker is a handsy drunk—says to me, \"I need to fuck a big bitch right now. Please look around and help me find a thick ass cosplayer.\" My man's a BBWarrior. I'd humor him n' reply, \"Let see if Syl wants to help shoot a shot.\"</p>\n<p>Syl, being a lil' ball of anxiety she is, says somethin' to the effect that it would scare the shit outta her if she got a baddie. So, that kinda calm Cheese a bit. We made our way to the console arcade after sayin goodbye to Syl's friends. As we passed through the artist alley to the arcade, Cheese would stop me to look at a booth that had a bunch of Sonic art to tell me how much he loved Sonic. \"Shadow is so cool.\" Luckily, Cheese's friends were at the arcade so I passed him off to 'em to make sure he'd get back safely to his room.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">I love my friend Cheese.</p>",

Fantastic pixel art and the gameplay looks super interestin'. After, Syl played a bit of Hyper Light Breaker. She played it for so long... so Cheese n' I browsed the rest of the indie arcade. Afterwards, Cheese went to browse the artist alley a bit more on his own. I forgot to take a picture of the Kingdom of the Dump CRT display. So I went back to go get it. Lost Syl in the process lol.

Syl n' I then headed to the bar nearby to meet up with their friends. Had a funny bar experience where a dude in a Sonic onesie asked if we wanted to paint vaginas n' dicks. Also, a nice lady gave us some star-shaped soap. Syl kinda needs it cuz they stinky lol get owned Syl if ur reading this &gt;:)</p>\n<p>We went to another bar in the Gaylord to get some food. Spend the time drawin' as Syl was rantin' to their friend, Space Lion, about politics n' how shit Elon n' Trump are (very true). THEN after that, we went back to the previous bar to meet up with some other peeps. They spend a lot of time talkin about RPGs n' such. Had a great time talk about Tales Of n' original characters/ideas with Syl n' this guy called Wayne (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/@Wayneisboss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wayneisboss</a>).

The dodge didn't have i-frames, you couldn't cancel attack animations outside of other attacks, n' jumping felt awkward. I might be miss rememberin' it, but Ann definitely felt stiffer to control.</p>\n<p>Playing Ann now? It's such a drastic improvement. Attack animations can be canceled with dodges, guards, n' jumps. Jumping no longer feels sluggish to control mid-air. Hell, ThinkingStars even implemented command inputs n' for some attacks, like quarter circles! Makes me wish movement could be bound to the d-pad. Though, a lot of that comes from muscle memory from playin' 2D games, but the option would be nice.</p>\n<p>Props to ThinkingStars for creatin' Ann's core combat mechanics fun to use.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Enemy Design:</u></strong><br>While I like how simple n' enjoyable ANNO's combat is, its enemy design leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n<p>If you have a good grasp on how Ann controls, enemies end up as combo fodder, but then the game introduces heavy enemies (heavies) with a blue bar above their health bar ya need to be mindful of. This blue bar has heavies resisting launcher attacks n' most hit-stun until it's depleted. Even if you deplete the blue bar, heavies go into timed daze state that limits your option to a \"Kill Move\" that either kills 'em or significantly cuts their health down.</p>\n<p>I can appreciate why heavies exist—to give some sort of challenge—but this starts to become a problem since it pigeonholes the interactions with 'em. Which, also brings some bosses having the same problem. Giant enemy crab, wack his blue bar down, n' press button to do big damage. Sure, there are options you have with Ann on how fast the blue bar dwindles, but ya still have to interact with that blue bar.</p>\n<p>The blue bar ends up feelin' like stopgap. Why would I bother tryin' to use the cool command inputs, charge attacks, pause combos, or launchers if half the enemy pool won't react to 'em? Well, heavies not reacting to what I listed above is mostly true. Heavies can be put into a knocked down state with charge attacks. I still need to experiment how, n' if, I can make it consistent. Though, I think stopgap is the right word since what charge attacks can do gives me the impression that ThinkingStars were planning something more to the enemies.</p>\n<p>What the enemy design is now feels like a messy foundation n' it's gonna need refinement. What that refinement is? I'll leave that for the devs to ponder on.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Story &amp; Characters:</u></strong><br>Shallow. That's puttin' it concisely. Either not takin' advantage of its cyberpunk setting or character's arcs reachin' their conclusions in a boring way, there's nothing substantial that stood out to me. Like, there's character moments where I'd go: \"Wow, that's nice... wish their was somethin' significant prior that lead up to it.\"</p>\n<p>I was much more interested in the dynamics n' history of Ann's foster family than her being the key to communicating with inter-dimensional worlds. I think that if Ann's foster family played more of a major role than just her brother n' Ayane I'd be more invested honestly. With what I got... it was cute or serviceable, but not fantastic.</p>\n<p>Ayane n' Ann though? They kinda build pesbian. Anyway, Ann has her moments, but she definitely feels like I'm watching paint dry. At least it's blue paint. Ayane? Well... she likes Ann a lot (omg they're \"roommates\") n' she's a hecker. I won't say much about the rest of the cast in Anno, since the game doesn't really say much about 'em. Feels like characters just say their piece n' they're gone.<br><br>Sorry if my criticism doesn't make much sense here. I'm really strugglin' to say somethin' constrictive because I lost interest in what character's motivations were a bit before the halfway point of the game. So, take what I say above with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Presentation:</u></strong><br>I love 2D sprites in 3D environments. That shit's my jam! Art direction of the backgrounds n' settings is primo! I love it. More of it please.</p>\n<p>Vanguard Sound made some heat. God like OST.Some of my favs: Rum And Coke, Rooftop, Absalom, n' Here They Come.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong><br>ThinkingStars are definitively a studio I'll be keeping my eye on. I may not be 100% positive on all of their gameplay ideas or their characters/story, but I see how earnest they are with this game and that makes me want to support 'em.</p>\n<p>Might get a better feel for gameplay n' story with new game plus.</p>",
